Effects of climate variability on arctic bumblebee trait space and interaction networks - data and code availability

Bumblebee trait and interacton data used to generate all hypervolumes and interaction networks is available as 'Working_spreadsheet_BB_observ_18192122_v2', 
with associated metadata including explanation of all columns available as an additional text file.

Temperature data from Abisko weather station used in analyses of changes with development temperature are available in 'temperature_1985-2023.csv'.

All R scripts used to generate the project results are numbered 1-6 in the order in which they should be run and following the structure of the report.

Additional R scripts for calculations used to establish sample sizes and compare temperature regimes are labeled A-C, with additional details available in the Appendices.
