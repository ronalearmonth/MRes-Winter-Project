#### Explanation of the column in the working spreadsheet for 2018, 2019, 2021 & 2022


##Year, Date, month, DOY, Week no

Year = The year the data were collected
Month = The month the data were collected (as a number, i.e. 5 = May)
Date = The date at which the bee sampling occurred as DD/MM/YYYY
DOY = The day of the respective year at which the bee sampling occurred
	(calculated as Date - 1st Jan +1)
Week no = rough week during the season at which the bee sampling occurred
		As bee sampling occurred fours days a week, week no should increase every four sampling days
		However, I think there are some errors in this column where people were confused about which week they were on


##Sample no, bee no
Bee No = Every year, each bee observed was given a unique number that increased as the season progressed
		No Bees refers to plot samples in which no bees were seen, so just contains the weather conditions for that plot
		In 2018, No bees are written instead as "NXXX", as they numbered each time no bees were observed.
Sample No = Bee No and Year combined, so every bee within the dataset should have a unique Sample No


##Sub transect, Sub transect numbered, vegetation zone, altitude and plot photo
Sub Transect  = refers to the bumblebee sampling plot (thirteen in total) -> the name of each sampling plot refers to the two poles along the transect that the plot is between
Sub Transect numbered = the number of the sampling plot going up the mountain
				E.g. 04-05 is the lowest elevation sampling plot and is numbered 1
					73-74 is the highest elevation sampling plot and is numbered 13
Vegetation Zone = Which vegetation zone does the plot lie in? This ranges from A (Old Birch forest) to E (alpine heath).
Altitude = The mean sampling plot elevation (estimated as =  (elevation of bottom transect pole for plot + elevation of top transect pole for plot)/2)
Plot photo = For each sampling period, a photo of the plot was taken
		There should be a photo for each plot observation, but sometimes this was not taken, and a lot are missing for 2019


##time start, time end, stopwatch time, within 20, n loops, observer/catcher
Time Start = time of day that the sampling started; formatted as hh:mm:ss
Time End = time of day that the sampling finished; formatted as hh:mm:ss
Stop watch time = "length" of the observation period; should be roughly 20 min; formatted as hh:mm:ss
Within 20 = was the bee caught within 20 mins of sampling (this was only recorded for 2018)
N_loops = How many times was the sampling plot walked around? Should be roughly 2.
Observer/Catcher = Who performed the sampling?


##Activity flying foraging, quadrant, catch
Activity_flying_foraging = what was the bee doing when it was observed?
					Foraging means the bee was specifically on a flower (and hopefully feeding)
					Flying is a "catch all" for all non-foraging activities; 
						e.g. sometimes the bee was crawling on the ground (should say in notes), but we recorded this bee as flying.
Quadrat_observed_in = Where was the bee observed within the plot? Defined when looking up the transect
				BL = bottom left; TL = top left; BR = bottom right; TR = top right
Catch_Y_N = Was the bee caught? If Y, then the bee should also have a photo, tarsal clip, paint pen & other processing information
				

###bombus species, bombus species certainty, bee photo number, bee photo chosen acj, social parasitic
Bombus_Species = bee species identity; if we weren't sure, then multiple species names would be given, separated by a slash
			Bombus alpinus and Bombus polaris were grouped as a species complex, as were Bombus norvegicus and B. sylvestris
Bombus_species_certainty = How confident were we about the bee species identity? Ranges from 1 (not confident) to 3 (very confident)
Bee Photo number = The photo(s) taken of the bee during processed
Bee Photo Chosen ACJ = If multiple photos were taken during processing, this column specifies the photo number in which intertegular distance 
				can be most accurately measured. In this column, the photo numbers are also formatted to be able to easily merge with data extracted from the photos themselves
Social_parasitic = is the bee species a social parasite? Y = Parasitic (note that parasitic species should have no worker caste)


###Caste, caste certainty, caste assigned ct
Caste = Caste assigned in the field: Q = queen; W = worker; D = drone
Caste certainty = How confident were we in how the caste was assigned? 1 = not confident; 3 = very confident
			This was not recorded in 2018, so I assigned all 2018 bees with an intertegular distance a confidence score of 2
Caste assigned CT = Caste assigned according to a binomial model based on body size of queens and workers

###Flower species, flower photo, corrected flower species id, corrected flower species id2, flower sample, flower height
Flower species = if the bee was foraging, what flower was it seen on? [What was originally recorded in the field]
Flower photo = photo(s) taken of the plant species for identification purposes
Corrected flower species ID = Flower species after some corrections from Christine
Corrected flower species ID2 = All plant photos were uploaded to inaturalist, to have species identity confirmed; 
						This columns also contains observations that were confirmed through inaturalist


###weather -> these variables were recorded in the field prior to observations; they are probably not very accurate

##tag, tag applied
Tag applied = in 2018, tags were applied to bees, so if an individual was recaptured, the original bee could be identified (Y/N/NA)
Tag = the type of tag that was applied; should have a colour and a number

###recapture, paint pen, pollen present, pollen collected, tarsal clip
Should all be Y/N or NA

Recapture = For bees caught in the field, had they been caught previously? (as identified through presence of white paint pen)
Paint pen = when a bee was caught, did we apply paint pen?
Pollen present = For caught bees, is there pollen in the pollen sac?
Pollen collected = If caught bees carried pollen, did we take a sample?
Tarsal clip = for caught bees, did we take a DNA sample (tarsal clip)?


###intertegular distance, wing length, head width
These are based off measurements from photos of the bees; all measured in TPS dig and merged into observation data using Bee photo chosen ACJ

Intertegular distance (cm) = distance between where the wings join the bee's thorax
Wing length (cm) = distance between one of the tegulae and the bottom-most wing vein
Head width (cm) = furthest distance between distal points of the bee's eyes

###estimated prementum length, estimated total tongue length
These are based off mixed-effects models that relate aspects of tongue length to bee species, caste and intertegular distance; both rounded to 3 significant figures
 
Estimated_prementum_length_cm = estimated length of the hard section of the top of the tongue (prementum); measured in tps dig
Est_total_tongue_length_cm = estimated length of the total tongue (prementum + glossa); measured in ImageJ
